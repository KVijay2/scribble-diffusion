# 🖍️ Scribble Diffusion

## How it works

This app is powered by:

🚀 [Replicate](https://replicate.com/?utm_source=project&utm_campaign=scribblediffusion), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.

🖍️ [ControlNet](https://replicate.com/jagilley/controlnet-scribble?utm_source=project&utm_campaign=scribblediffusion), an open-source machine learning model that generates images from text and scribbles.

⚡️ Next.js [server-side API routes](pages/api), for talking to the Replicate API.

👀 Next.js React components, for the browser UI.

🍃 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), for styles.
